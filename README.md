# No loss Lottery program on solana


- No loss lottery â€” A lottery in which participants do not loose their money. i.e they still get a refund if they don't win the lottery and the winner still gets rewarded



### So How does the winner get rewarded if non winners still get a full refund?

All the funds deposited into the lottery vault are invested into a lending pool in order to yield some interest. it is from that interest that the winner gets rewarded and fees are taken (if need be)

### Kindly Note
